#Aim:
This project aims to build a Spark Streaming pipeline leveraging Azure Synapse Analytics and Azure Cosmos DB. It will implement tumbling and sliding window functions for efficient data processing, perform data joins across multiple sources, and create logic apps for email alerts based on specific conditions. The goal is to demonstrate the integration of Azure Synapse and Cosmos DB, alongside advanced data processing techniques for real-time analytics and automated event handling.
